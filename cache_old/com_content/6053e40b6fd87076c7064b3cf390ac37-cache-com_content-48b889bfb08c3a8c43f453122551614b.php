<div>Hydroelectricity - The Solution for Energy Crisis or an outdated technology</div>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<div><br />Introduction&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />After industrialization, the growth of human race was accelerated. Factories and skyscrapers become a common sight in 20<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;century. Energy became our fundamental need. Our average daily energy usage raised more than 100 times in the past century. The natural energy sources become insufficient for human needs. We start depending on Fossil fuel and nuclear energy which are the most efficient energy sources. Years past, and we are now facing an energy crisis. Fossil fuel is no longer an&nbsp;endless source. Nuclear power plants are causing great damage to environment. It is clear that non-renewable resources are not the way to future. It is the time to look back to the nature.&nbsp;</div>
<br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>We have endless renewable energy sources in the nature. The most common and traditional energy source is hydroelectricity. We have a long history with hydropower. It starts from Mesopotamia and ancient Egypt since the 6th millennium BC. Water wheels, water mills, turbines, compressed air hydro etc were some popular methods to gain energy from water. There are lot of hydroelectric power generating methods. Dams, Run-of-the-river, pumped-storage etc are some examples. Even though there are many methods, dams and reservoirs are the most common and effective hydroelectric power generation method.&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Hydroelectric Plants</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Hydroelectric plants are one of the first generation technologies. First-generation technologies are most competitive in locations with abundant resources. Among the renewable resources, hydroelectric plants are the oldest power source. Some plants are operating for more than 100 years. The first commercial plant was built near Niagara Falls in US in&nbsp;1881. Then there were a huge growth in number of power plants. By 1889 there were 200 plants in the US alone. At the beginning of 20th century, there was a boom in hydro electricity. Commercial companies start building small power plants in mountains near to cities. By 1920, 40 percentage of US energy was from hydroelectricity. The scenario was almost same in the other developed countries. Relate to dams’ irrigation projects and flood control plans were started.&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>In 1930s and 1940s, some massive and effective dams were constructed around the globe. The most famous dam in the world, Hoover Dam was constructed in 1936 with an initial capacity of 1345 MW. Grand Coulee Dam overtook Hoover Dam in 1942 with 6809 MW capacity. There are three dams larger than 10 GW in the world now, the Three Gorges Dam in China with 22.5 GW,&nbsp;Itaipu Dam in Brazil with 14 GW and Guri Dam in Venezuela with 10 GW capacities. Three more are under construction, Xiluodu Dam in China with 12.6 GW, Belo Monte Dam in Brazil with 11.2 GW, Siang Upper HE Project in India with 11 GW.&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The total energy production from hydroelectricity around the world&nbsp; is less than 10%. China is the major producer with 721 terawatt-hours of production per year, accounting 17% their total usage. Currently 150 countries are producing hydroelectricity. Countries like Brazil, Venezuela, Canada, Norway, Austria, New Zealand etc produce majority of their energy from hydropower. Paraguay produces 100% of its electricity from hydroelectric dams, and exports 90% of its production to Brazil and to Argentina. Norway produces 99% energy for their internal energy usage from hydroelectric sources.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Hydroelectricity is not just about big dams and thousands of mega watts projects. There are small hydro electric projects which are considered sustainable and effective. In the rural regions where power transmission is very difficult, these plants are helpful. Energy is produced by installing turbines on river or collects water on small storages and flow it to the turbine. This is called Run-of-the-river hydroelectricity. The electricity produced is used to power the nearby localities.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Advantages over non-renewable sources</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The main advantage of hydroelectric plants is low cost energy. Not like Fossil fuel sources the cost will not vary time by time. Once the plant is installed, the only cost is for maintenance. Since the source is non ending, there is no need of money wastage on source. The plants are generally long living; some plants are in good condition for more than 100 years. Even the construction cost is less comparing nuclear or coal power plants of same production capacity. The labour cost is low too considering the fact that the plans need only minimal attention.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Hydroelectric dams produce only very minimal amount of CO<sub>2</sub>. That also happens at the time of construction. It is very small comparing the emissions of fossil fuel plants. According to studies, hydroelectricity produces the least amount of green house gases than any other sources. Dams are not only used for energy production but also used for irrigation and agriculture. We can say that hydroelectric dams are the source which creates major social impacts.&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Siltation and flow shortage issues</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The river which brings water to the dam also brings heavier particles with it. This includes organic particles and sand. This will deposit on the dams and gradually reduce its capacity. This is called siltation. This can increase pressure in dams and cause its failure. Since energy production is proportional to the water level, it will&nbsp;seriously&nbsp;affect the power generation. Some plants are abandoned because of excessive siltation in the reservoir. Enloe Dam in America is an example.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Environmental Issues</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Environmental issues related of dams are mainly due to the area which the dam floods. Since the dams needs large storage area, it has to flood a large region for functioning. Power generation capacity of the dam increases with increase in water storage and it will harm environment proportionally. To date, over 400,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;of the earth have been flooded due to damming.&nbsp;</div>

</table>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>In general dams are situated on mountain ranges which are surrounded by thick forest. When a dam is constructed in the area, it floods the whole forest region. In fact a normal dam floods 100 to 500 hectors of surrounding area. Which means a huge number of trees and animals goes under water. It will affect the ecosystem badly. Not only it will kill a large number of species but the anaerobic decay of the forest produce tremendous amount of methane which is a much stronger greenhouse gas than CO<sub>2</sub>. In some cases, the flooded basins are produce methane which has pollution potential 3.5 times more than an oil-fired power plant would for the same generation capacity.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>A contemporary issue related to this is the issue related to the proposed Athirapally Dam.&nbsp; Athirapally is a major tourist place in Trissur district, Kerala. The proposed dam would have submerged more than 140 hectares of forest, dried up extensive riparian areas downstream and destroyed Athirapally Waterfall, one of several scenic waterfalls important to the local tourism industry. The dam also would have destroyed critical habitat of many important species, including the rare Cochin Forest Cane Turtle, the endangered Great Indian Hornbill, the Lion-Tailed Macaque and the Nilgiri Langur. Because of these reasons the dam failed to get the environmental clearance.</div>
<div><br />Another important issue was related to 11 GW Upper Siang Hydroelectric Project. Considering the fact that the project will give a great contribution to the grid, the Environment Ministry gave clearance to the dam. Narmada Bachao Andolan lead by Medha Patkar and Baba Amte against the height increasing of the Sardar Sarovar Dam was an important milestone in protest against environmental issues raised by dams.&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<br />
<div>Social issues</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<br />
<div>Social issues raised by the dams including&nbsp;Diseases&nbsp;and Relocation. Reservoirs can become breeding grounds for disease vectors. This includes mosquitoes and snails which takes advantage of slow moving water. Dams require relocation of large number of population who leaves around the specified area. It is because of the flood plain issue.&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<br />
<div>The record for the largest population relocated belongs to the 22.5 GW Three Gorges Dam built in China. Its reservoir submerged a large area of land, forcing over a million people to relocate. Another example is the Indira Sagar (Polavaram) Project in Andra Pradesh. It is estimated that the project will affect 175,275 persons from Andhra Pradesh, 6,316 persons from Orissa and 11,766 from Chhattisgarh. Polavaram Project would displace about 73,000 Scheduled Tribe persons in 299 villages in the States of Andhra Pradesh, Orissa and Chhattisgarh.&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<br />
<div>Failure threats</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<br />
<div>Dams are considered "installations containing dangerous forces" under International Humanitarian Law due to the massive impact of a possible destruction on the civilian population and the environment. Dam failures are normally rare, but it can wipe out a large population in a very short time.&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<br />
<div>The Banqiao and Shimantan Dam failure (1975) in china is a classic example. It is the biggest of 61 known dam failures. The reason was extreme rainfall beyond the planned design capability of the dam. The dam failures killed an estimated 171,000 people; 11 million people lost their homes. The energy released was equivalent to 18 GW, equivalent to the power of 20 nuclear reactors.&nbsp;</div>

</table>
The famous&nbsp;Mullaperiyar Dam&nbsp;issue is related to dam failure threat. Mullaperiyar is a 100 year old Dam is situated in Idukki district, Kerala. After the 1979 Morvi Dam failure which killed up to 15,000 people in Gujarat,<sup>&nbsp;</sup>safety concerns of the aging Mullaperiyar dam's were raised by the Kerala Government. The issue become fear to the people of Kerala after the report by IIT Roorkee in 2009 stated that the dam "was likely to face damage if an earthquake of the magnitude of 6.5 on the Richter scale struck its vicinity when the water level is at 136 feet". It is estimated that the failure may affect 3.5 million people in Kerala.&nbsp; Since the water from the dam is extremely important for the farmers of Tamilnadu, the Tamilnadu government is not willing to demolish the dam. The issue is now under the Supreme Court.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<br />
<div>Conclusion</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<br />
<div>Hydroelectricity is an effective and important form of renewable energy. It is a first generation sustainable energy technology.&nbsp;Generally speaking, hydroelectric plants produce much lower life-cycle emissions than other types of power generation. Some plants are still working for more than 100 years. But the dams constructed cause various environmental and social issues. To avoid those there should be better planning and environmental studies before every project. It is better to concentrate on second and third generation technologies like solar energy, biomass and ocean energy which cause minimal impact to earth.</div>

<p class="c8 c1"><span>Depending on how you are using Methvin (and other things like your configuration, the edition you are using, etc) you will organize your information in some of the following “dimensions”:</span></p>
<ol class="c18" start="1">
<li class="c2 c1"><span>Projects</span></li>
<li class="c2 c1"><span>Pricing</span></li>
<li class="c1 c2"><span>Resources</span></li>
<li class="c2 c1"><span>Claims</span></li>
<li class="c2 c1"><span>Subcontractor adjudication</span></li>
<li class="c2 c1"><span>Suppliers</span></li>
<li class="c2 c1"><span>Subcontractors</span></li>
<li class="c2 c1"><span>Documents</span></li>
<li class="c2 c1"><span>Other (not covered in this section)</span></li>
</ol>
<p class="c1 c36"><span>Some of the above will give you access to what we call the “full add”, which is our short-name for the form that allows you to input all the detailed information</span></p>

<h3 class="c12 c1"><a name="h.g0gmyc5a3y8"></a><span>Importing a client supplied schedule</span></h3>
<p class="c8 c1"><span>The best practice to insure a trouble free import of the Clients Schedule is by following this step by step procedure:</span></p>
<ol class="c18" start="1">
<li class="c2 c1"><span>First export an existing schedule, by clicking the Export to Excel Icon in the Pricing Module.</span></li>
<li class="c2 c1"><span>This will give you the excel import structure (i.e. Column header descriptions and sequence of columns) for your import.</span></li>
<li class="c2 c1"><span>Copy your new client supplied information to their appropriate column headers, then save the file.</span></li>
<li class="c2 c1"><span>Click on the Import Schedule icon to upload the clients schedule, Navigate to your newly created file and select it, then click the save button, this will import your client supplied schedule into the pricing module. </span></li>
</ol>

<h2 class="c1"><a name="h.g2mn5qjp7q6t"></a><span>Export Projects</span></h2>
<h3 class="c12 c1"><a name="h.csku9yci3i12"></a><span>Important information to remember when exporting a project</span></h3>
<p class="c12 c1"><span>When exporting a Project file, it is important to remembered that only the physical text data is saved, none of the uploaded files in the documents module are backed up to the file. When backing up your documents it is recommended you download them to your local computer. There is a “save” process within the system to allow you to zip save the entire documents content to your local drive.</span></p>
<p class="c12 c1"><span>(pic)</span></p>
<h3 class="c12 c1"><a name="h.xg9gvvbe04wb"></a><span>Export a specific Project</span></h3>
<p class="c8 c1"><span>From the Projects window situated on the left hand side of the screen, right click on the Project you wish to download. This brings up the projects quick menu, select the Export Project menu item. This will save the project sql file to your computer. Important note, this does not save your uploaded files which were saved under the Documents Module. </span></p>
<h2 class="c1"><a name="h.d4jf35887cc"></a><span>Import Project</span></h2>
<h3 class="c12 c1"><a name="h.22k8dhsjgukq"></a><span>Import a specific Project sql file</span></h3>
<p class="c8 c1"><span>From the Projects window situated on the left hand side of the screen, add a new project to import your project into. From the righthand click import project menu navigate to the project file you wish to import, then click the save button, this will import your project.</span></p>
<h2 class="c1"><a name="h.x9nq7zzf3wub"></a><span>Duplicate Project</span></h2>
<p class="c8 c1"><span>From the projects right hand click menu select the Duplicate Project option, and by doing so it will make a copy of the selected project just below itself.</span></p>
<h2 class="c1"><a name="h.8ztavi6w3sp5"></a><span>Import Resource Schedule</span></h2>
<p class="c8 c1"><span>Following the following step by step procedure to import your resource schedule:</span></p>
<ol class="c18" start="5">
<li class="c2 c1"><span>Follow the Heading structure from the Resource Module, to insure the information is imported correctly. </span></li>
<li class="c2 c1"><span>Click on the Import Resource Schedule icon to upload your Resource Schedule, Navigate to your file and select it, then click the save button, this will import your Resource Schedul into the resource module.</span></li>
</ol>
<h1 class="c1"><a name="h.y389rc2kbzaa"></a><span>Pricing Module</span></h1>
<h2 class="c1"><a name="h.18jfim13w60c"></a><span>Basic Pricing</span></h2>
<p class="c12 c1"><span>Basic pricing is possible through inserting your required gross rate into pricing tabs gross rate column. This can then be printed as a client report. This saves automatically and you have successfully &nbsp;created your first price response in Methvin.</span></p>
<h2 class="c1"><a name="h.u2g57y37uchz"></a><span>Complex Worksheet Pricing</span></h2>
<p class="c12 c1"><span>Under each item in the schedule there is a worksheet dynamically attached. Here you can drag in resources or worksheets from the accordion menu on the right side of the pricing module, decreasing your pricing time and improving the accuracy of your tender.</span></p>
<h3 class="c1"><a name="h.y6m782lfya6x"></a><span>Pricing with Variables</span></h3>
<p class="c12 c1"><span>The complex worksheet allows you to set variables for pricing, for example the distance from a quarry to the site or the depth of a trench. When you set up a new project, with a similar item to price, &nbsp;all that is required is to adjust the variables to the new circumstances. </span></p>
<h3 class="c1"><a name="h.88dew969ofe2"></a><span>The Function column</span></h3>
<p class="c12 c1"><span>This facilitates the use of any mathematical function. Caution, &nbsp;watch the brackets when using complicated equations.</span></p>
<p class="c1 c12"><span class="c14">[Pic]</span></p>
<h3 class="c12 c1"><a name="h.f3ws1k74r5j9"></a><span>Java Functions</span></h3>
<p class="c12 c1"><span>Unique to Methvin, you are able to utilise any </span><span class="c0"><a class="c3" href="http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_obj_math.asp">function available in Java</a></span><span>&nbsp;to automate your complex pricing. </span></p>
<p class="c12 c1"><span>Examples:</span></p>
<p class="c12 c1"><span>if ([</span><span class="c14">“your variable”</span><span>2]&gt;5) {yes} else {no} - Returns no </span></p>
<p class="c12 c1"><span>Math.round(2.5) - Returns 3</span></p>
<p class="c12 c1"><span>var x = Math.PI - Returns PI</span></p>
<p class="c12 c1"><span>var y = Math.sqrt(16) - Returns the square root of 16</span></p>
<p class="c12 c1"><span class="c14">[Pic]</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c35">Sub-schedules</span></p>
<p class="c12 c1"><span>When the client provides one item for a complex section of work, &nbsp;for example, a Lump Sum Item calls for the construction of a bridge. If you change the item into a sub-schedule item by clicking on the icon at the top of the Pricing Module, any items pertaining to the sub-section item will roll up the clients item when printing out this report. Under the sub-schedule you are able to add as much detail as you require, to allow you to price the item accurately. The Client report will reflect only the Lump sum as dictated by the sub- schedule, in this case “Bridge”.</span></p>
<h2 class="c1"><a name="h.gyd1465etcow"></a><span>Copying Pricing</span></h2>
<p class="c12 c1"><span>There are two ways in which you can speed up your pricing by copying detailed pricing from previously priced projects:</span></p>
<ol class="c24" start="1">
<li class="c1 c20 c28"><span>Select the principle project from the dropdown box at the top of the Pricing Module</span></li>
<li class="c28 c1 c20"><span>Import an item and its detailed pricing from any project into your schedule. This is done by dragging and dropping from the righthand side accordions menu ‘Copy Item &amp; Pricing’ the item across to your schedule.</span></li>
</ol>
<p class="c1"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OR</span></p>
<ol class="c24" start="1">
<li class="c28 c1 c20"><span>Copy the detailed pricing from a previous project by going to the right hand side accordions menu ‘Copy Pricing’ drag an item down to the detailed pricing tab at the bottom of the Pricing Module.</span></li>

<p class="c1 c23"><span>Once you are satisfied with your tender price it is possible to lock all the gross rates by selecting the checkbox icon in the pricing module menu.</span></p>
<h2 class="c1"><a name="h.3vziv3i4224x"></a><span>Imbalanced Rates</span></h2>
<p class="c12 c1"><span>Once you have accurately priced up an item and come up with its cost rate the item is automatically marked up by the default markup as set in the Pricing Module. If for any reason you believe the item to be over or under scheduled, it is very easy to adjust its markup by either inputting the required Gross Rate or inputting the required percentage markup. This then automatically locks in the new markup by setting the lock gross rate checkbox to “true”.</span></p>
<h2 class="c1"><a name="h.1gbtbus8d6iw"></a><span>Markup - % for the Entire Project</span></h2>
<p class="c12 c1"><span>In the top right hand side of the screen under the Pricing Module it is possible to select the percentage that you would like to mark up the entire project. Once you have selected the required markup, click on the “Calculate” button at the top of the screen, this will adjust the percentage markup for the entire project to your revised markup percentage. If any items have been locked to allow for imbalanced items rates, they will be ignored and their previous markup will remain.</span></p>
<h2 class="c1"><a name="h.2l3vlfut66cm"></a><span>Markup - Individual Items</span></h2>
<p class="c12 c1"><span>For example if you wish to markup a section of the schedule by 3% and the rest of the project by 8.5% it is possible to set the global percentage markup as described before to 3% then click the calculate button. Individually set the ‘Lock?’ button to true for the section of the schedule you wish to mark up by 3%. Change the global percentage markup to 8.5% and click the calculate button once more, this will then markup the remainder of the scheduled items which don't have there checkboxes selected up the required 8.5%.</span></p>

<p class="c1"><span>One of the key features of Methvin is that you can not only upload, download and share any type of document but that you can edit files online to a certain degree as well.

<p class="c8 c1"><span>In the list view of the Documents module you can see all files of the current project. Note the Edit button, and below Actions, some files have this and others don't. This distinguishes between files that are editable online and files that can just be downloaded.</span></p>

<p class="c5 c1"><span>When the Actions column in the list view is active you will notice that there are four different types of documents, with different options in this column:</span></p>
<p class="c5 c1"><span>[Pic]</span></p>
<p class="c5 c1"><span>The first action (the arrow button) is available for most document types; it lets you download the currently selected files to your local hard drive. </span></p>
<p class="c5 c1"><span>The rest is specific to a certain document type - Note the following examples.</span></p>
<ol class="c24" start="1">
<li class="c4 c1"><span>The standard document (for example a Word or a Photoshop file); this type of document can only be downloaded.</span></li>
<li class="c4 c1"><span>The editable document; here you have the choice between downloading and editing.</span></li>

<h2>Project Proverbs</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>The same work under the same conditions will be estimated differently by ten different estimators, or by one estimator at ten different times</li>
<li>The most valuable and least used word in a project manager's vocabulary is "NO"</li>
<li>You can con a sucker into committing to an unreasonable deadline, but you can't bully him into meeting it</li>
<li>The more ridiculous the deadline, the more it costs to meet it</li>
<li>The more desperate the situation, the more optimistic the situatee</li>
<li>Too few people on a project can't solve the problem - too many create more problems than they solve</li>
<li>You can freeze the clients specifications, but he won't stop expecting</li>
<li>Frozen specifications and the abominable snowman are alike :- they both are myths, and they both melt when sufficient heat is applied</li>
<li>The conditions attached to a promise are forgotten, and the promise is remembered</li>
<li>What you don't know hurts you</li>
<li>A client will tell you anything you ask - but nothing more</li>
<li>Of several possible interpretations of a communication, the least convenient one is the only correct one</li>
<li>What is not on paper has not been said</li>
<li>No major project is ever installed on time, within budget, and with the same staff that started it</li>
<li>Projects progress quickly until they become 95% complete; then they remain at 95% complete forever</li>
<li>If project content is allowed to change freely, then the rate of change will soon exceed the rate of progress</li>
<li>No major system is ever completely debugged; attempts to debug a system inevitably introduce new bugs that are even harder to find</li>
<li>Project teams detest progress reporting because it vividly demonstrates their lack of progress</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>There's never enough time to do it right first time but there's always enough time to go back and do it again.</li>
<li>If you fail to plan you are planning to fail.</li>
<li>A little risk management saves a lot of fan cleaning.</li>
<li>The sooner you get behind schedule, the more time you have to make it up.</li>
<li>A badly planned project will take three times longer than expected - a well planned project only twice as long as expected.</li>
<li>When all's said and done a lot more is said than done.</li>
<li>If at first you don't succeed, remove all evidence you ever tried.</li>
<li>The more you plan the luckier you get.</li>
<li>Good project management is not so much knowing what to do and when, as knowing what excuses to give and when.</li>
<li>Everyone asks for a strong project manager - when they get him they don't want him.</li>
<li>Overtime is a figment of the naïve project manager's imagination.</li>
<li>All project managers face problems on Monday mornings - good project managers are working on next Monday's problems.</li>
<li>Never underestimate the ability of senior management to buy a bad idea and fail to buy a good idea.</li>
<li>If it wasn't for the 'last minute' nothing would get done.</li>
<li>Meetings are where minutes are kept and hours are lost.</li>
<li>Good project managers don't solve problems, they get rid of them.</li>
<li>If you want to make Murphy laugh: have a definite plan.</li>
<li>If everything seems to be going well, you obviously don't know what's going on (Edward Murphy).</li>
<li>The plan is nothing. Planning is everything (President Dwight D. Eisenhower)</li>
<li>"The difference between genius and stupidity is that genius has its&nbsp;limits." - Albert Einstein</li>
<li>"Two things are infinite: the universe and human stupidity; and I'm not&nbsp;sure about the universe." - Albert Einstein</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Project Management Laws</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>If it can go wrong it will - Murphy's law.</li>
<li>If it can't possibly go wrong, it will - O'Malley's corollary to Murphy's law.</li>
<li>It will go wrong in the worst possible way - Sod's law.</li>
<li>Work expands to fill the time available for its completion - Parkinson's law.</li>
<li>Finely chopped cabbage in mayonnaise - Coleslaw.</li>
<li>If there is a 50% chance of something going wrong then 9 times out of 10 it will.</li>
<li>A two year project will take three years, a three year project will never finish - (anyone know who's law this is?)</li>
<li>Murphy, O'Malley, Sod and Parkinson are alive and well - and working on your project</li>
<li>Matzen's law. “For every function, there is an equal and opposite malfunction.”</li>
</ul>
