		<p><span lang="EN-GB">In the engineering world, concrete forms the fundamental unit and building block. It is made use of in more or less every type of construction that is built nowadays. This article provides some useful and practical engineering strategies to construction concrete, counting some paramount practices for a variety of state of affairs.</span></p>
 
<p><span lang="EN-GB">Being amongst the most widespread building materials, concrete is brought in use for strong foundational build-ups. From roadways and street construction to houses and almost every other construction amid, concrete is made use of somewhere or the other in it. Several people deem that concrete and cement are synonymous to one another. However, this judgment is incorrect. Both have discrete properties that are unlike the other, and such diverse characteristics make them practical in dissimilar applications. Concrete being a liquid fundamentally, on dispensing, it requires something to be kept in the desired shape or form. The required material would be detailed further in the article. The concrete material solidifies by a process called curing. The method of occurrence and processing during the curing process takes a while, but once created, it proves useful for the entire construction process that calls for concrete set up. Concrete independently is known to have great strength; however, it can be made even stronger by mixing it with other materials such as cement. In areas experiencing seismic commotions and going-ons, concrete is commonly made use of, but a number of precautions are required to be taken ion such areas while constructing, as such areas are prone to annihilation. Being affected by environmental and weather conditions, the preservation and care of concrete holds significance.</span></p>

<h2><span lang="EN-GB">Difference between Concrete and Cement</span></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">Though the terms concrete and cement are used synonymously often, cement is essentially a constituent of concrete. Fundamentally, a paste and aggregates mixture forms concrete, wherein the paste is portland cement and water, and the aggregates are crushed stones or gravel and sand. With time and duration, concrete gains more strength. Not being a brand name, portland cement is the general name given for the category of cement made use of in nearly things of concrete. It is comparable to both sterling and stainless, wherein sterling is a kind of silver, and stainless a steel kind. By volume, cement takes in 10%-15% of the concrete mixture. By &ldquo;hydration&rdquo; process, the water and cement fasten the aggregates and turn them into a rocklike heap. This process of hardening persists for years implying that concrete gains strength as time passes by. Therefore, terms like cement mixer, or cement sidewalk does not exist. The appropriate terms, instead, are concrete mixer and concrete sidewalk.</span></p>	</div>
