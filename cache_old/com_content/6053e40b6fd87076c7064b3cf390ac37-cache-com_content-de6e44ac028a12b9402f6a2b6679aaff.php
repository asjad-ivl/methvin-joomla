		<p>It is often a common misconception that the process managers for construction projects are quite under-educated. However, this is not at all true as the highly advanced field of commercial construction nowadays necessitates the requirement of highly specialized majors in the field of engineering and technology from the top technical schools. This is because the role of project management requires the individual to take ownership and responsibility for each and everything, right from ensuring the construction of the building exactly as per the design specified by the architect to answering the various questions posed by the subcontractors and solving them accordingly. They are often also made responsible for handling the project coordination and making the estimates for the same, as a reflection of the existent fair value in the property market. However, the most important task of a construction project manager is to effectively economize the project to the maximum extent possible and also ensure that any changes which are made to the construction project is priced in a proper manner.</p>
 
<p>With respect to construction project management, there are enormous benefits of working in this field. In addition to the rewarding experience of seeing the construction projects getting developed under one&rsquo;s direction, supervision and close monitoring, the various buildings can rightfully serve as a long-standing testament to all the hard work, which has been put into planning and building the same. This role serves as a challenge for people, who prefer to rather see concrete results from their hard work as opposed to being stuck in an office cubicle all day long. Moreover, the financial remuneration offered to the managers in the field of construction project management is quite lucrative and offers various perks such as car allowances as well as miscellaneous expense accounts. However, given the high work pressure and the fact that most of the large construction projects are operational for almost twenty-four hours and seven days a week, it is often requisite for the construction project managers to devote more than the industry standard of forty hours per week. This often translates into late and inconvenient working hours which may even be interspersed with additional burden in terms of managing exigencies as well as pulling all-nighters.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In terms of construction project management, the field offers the best work in the field of construction. However, the choice of this work requires one to be comfortable with working around heavy-duty machinery and in unfavorable conditions filled with noise, dirt as well as debris. Moreover, another challenge of this career choice is the interacting as well as working with all sorts of people ranging from highly professional patrons and the design teams to the tradesmen and the laborers. Another important consideration in this perspective is the job pressure as even slight delays in the schedule due to poor construction project management can lead to heavy penalization in monetary terms.</p>	</div>
